# Life6
This is a version of Conway's Game of Life on a hexigonal grid with specifiable
rules and wraparound edges, where cells in the top edge are adjacent
(identical, in my implementation) to the cells in the bottom edge, and left edge,
right edge.

I did this for a hackathon, but missed the submission deadline. Perfected it for fun anyway.

# Requires:
pygame, numpy
